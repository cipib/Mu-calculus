# Mu-calculus
For development I used IntelliJ IDEA 15.0.03. This project can be forked from https://github.com/cipib/Mu-calculus
To run the software: Open InteliJ -> import as project -> set MuCalculus as run-class (Run as -> MuCalculus.java) -> set input as program arguments (Edit configurations -> program arguments)
-> edit input with the fomula to test on the first line -> Run
